# Predicting Kickstarter success 

The goal of this project is to predict either success or failure of a kickstarter project.
For context, Kickstarter is a crowd sourcing platform where people can pledge money to ideas that they support and want to 
see in production. Each project creator defines a monetary goal they need to reach in order to fulfill their idea into life
and sets the duration of fundraising anywhere between 0 and 60 days. If the project is able to raise the money in allocated time
the project is considered successful and is then able to collect the pledged money and enter the production phase. If a project
fails to raise money they are closed down and money pledged are never collected.


## DATA 
Data used was provided by this website: [WebRobots](https://webrobots.io/kickstarter-datasets/)
WebRobots is a small Lithuanian company that provides web-scraping services. They scraped Kickstarted once a month for the past
several years and made that data available in json and csv files. 
I selected datasets for year 2019 for every other month and one for year 2017. 


## DATA PROCESSING
Each datapoint is a snapshot of a kickstarted project at a certain point in time. I used the latest dataset and selected 
all completed campaigns from it (excluding campaigns that were canceled for various reasons). I then went back to older datasets
and collected information on these completed projects at a time when they were roughly halfway through their duration.
After examining the available information i ended up with the following features:
Duration, Goal, Pledged-to-goal-ratio, Description Length, Country, Category, Is_Staff_Pick, Backers Count
and Outcome State(success or fail)

## CLASSIFICATION MODELS
For this classification problem I used the following models:
Single Decision Tree, Random Forest, ADA Boost, Gradient Boost, XGBboost, KNN, SVM and Logistic Regression
All models performed exceedingly well with Accuracy scored ranging from 92% to 99%

## CONCLUSION
The data collected included information about how much has the project raised halfway through its duration (Pledged-to-goal-ratio)
That variable alone ended up determining the outcome with close to 100% precision. In other words, if a project 
raised about half the total goal halfway through, it is very likely to reach the full goal amount in time. 
While this makes sense, it means that the analysis does not provide much additional insight.

## FURTHER ANALYSIS 
1. Collect same data at 10% of project duration - see if it's possible to make similar prediction based on data from a project 
that has just started
2. Discard pledged (and backers) variables all-together. Instead, collect additional data by scaraping the project full description 
and performing NLP analysis on it. We can also collect information about the creator of the project and include a count of 
support options that each project provides. The goal would be to predict the project outcome based on the metrics of the 
project itself excluding any information that measures the supporter level of interest. Such analysis would provide
